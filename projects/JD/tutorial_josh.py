# Step 1: Load an experiment
#
# An experiment handles a group of mice that were trained in the same behaviour. It
# stores data and metadata for all included sessions belonging to the list of mice
# provided. The Experiment class is passed the mouse or list of mice, the class
# definition for the behaviour they were trained in (imported from pixels.behaviours),
# and the paths where it can find recording data (the folder containing 'raw', 'interim'
# and 'processed' folders) and training metadata.
#
myexp = Experiment(
    'MCos1371',
    LeverPush,
    '~/duguidlab/thalamus_paper/Npx_data',
    '~/duguidlab/CuedBehaviourAnalysis/Data/TrainingJSON',
)


# Step 2: Process raw data
#
# These methods each process a different type of raw data and save the output into the
# 'processed' folder. The outputs are all resampled to 1kHz, and are saved as:
#
#    - action labels (.npy)
#    - behavioural data (.h5)
#    - spike data (.h5)
#    - lfp data (.h5)
#

# This aligns, crops and downsamples behavioural data.
myexp.process_behaviour()

# This aligns, crops and downsamples LFP data.
# myexp.process_lfp()

# This aligns, crops, and downsamples spike data.
# myexp.process_spikes()

# This performs spike sorting, and ...
# myexp.extract_spikes()

# This...
# myexp.process_motion_tracking()


# Step 3: Run analyses
#
# Once all the data has been processed and converted into forms that are compatible with
# the rest of the data, we are ready to extract data organised by trials.
